# Elite 102 Codebreakers Project

Tori Schulz - Spring 2021

## Overview

This project was used as a way to learn C# and how to work with text files. The program can perform a Caesar, ROTx, or Vigenere cipher on the input text file and then rewrites the new contents into the same original file. 

## Usage

The program takes command line arguments as a way for the user to specify the task to be completed. The arguments taken are file path, encode/decode, integer for ROTx shift value, cipher type, and keyword for vigenere cipher. Not all arguments are used in every situation so it is acceptable in those cases to leave arguments as none.
